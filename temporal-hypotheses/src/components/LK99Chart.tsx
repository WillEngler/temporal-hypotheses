While this claim has met with little support in a flurry of ensuing work, a variety of calculations (mostly based on density-functional theory) have demonstrated that the system possesses some unusual characteristics in the electronic structure, in particular flat bands. We have established previously that within DFT, the system is insulating with many characteristics resembling the classic cuprates, provided the structure is not constrained to the P3(143) symmetry nominally assigned to it. Here we describe the basic electronic structure of LK-99 within self-consistent many-body perturbative approach, quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approximation and their diagrammatic extensions. QSGW predicts that pristine LK-99 is indeed a Mott\/charge transfer insulator, with a bandgap gap in excess of 3eV, whether or not constrained to the P3(143) symmetry. The highest valence bands occur as a pair, and look similar to DFT bands. The lowest conduction band is an almost dispersionless state of largely Cu d character. When Pb9Cu(PO4)6O} is hole-doped, the valence bands modify only slightly, and a hole pocket appears. However, two solutions emerge: a high-moment solution with the Cu local moment aligned parallel to neighbors, and a low-moment solution with Cu aligned antiparallel to its environment. In the electron-doped case the conduction band structure changes significantly: states of mostly Pb character merge with the formerly dispersionless Cu d state, and high-spin and low spin solutions once again appear. Thus we conclude that with suitable doping, the ground state of the system is not adequately described by a band picture, and that strong correlations are likely.","lk99_veracity":"no","means":-0.6427688504,"iter_variances":0.4944375773,"likelihood":0.0062096653,"likelihood_adjusted":0.0968004846},{"paper_title":"The characteristics of LK-99 by Cu2S removal using ammonia solution: A diamagnetic semiconductor","doi":"10.48550\/arXiv.2309.17445","journal":"arxiv","journal_if":null,"citations":1,"date":1692489600000,"abstract":"In this study, we re-evaluated the superconducting properties of LK-99.

At the DFT level, the former is predicted to be metallic while the latter is found to be a charge-transfer insulator. In both cases the filling of these states is nominally d9, consistent with the Cu2+ valence state, and Cu with a local magnetic moment ~0.7mB. In the metallic case we find these states to be unusually flat (0.2 eV dispersion), giving high DOS at EF that we argue can be a host for novel electronic physics, including potentially high temperature superconductivity. The flatness of the bands is the likely origin of symmetry-lowering gapping possibilities that would remove the spectral weight from EF. Since some experimental observations show metallic\/semiconducting behavior, we propose that disorder is responsible for closing the gap. We consider a variety of possibilities that could possibly close the gap, but limit consideration to kinds of disorder that preserve electron count. For all possibilities we considered (spin disorder, O on vacancy sites, Cu on different Pb sites), the local Cu moment, and consequently the gap remains robust. We conclude that disorder responsible for metallic behavior entails some kind of doping where the electron count changes. We claim that the emergence of the flat bands should be due to weak wave function overlap between the Cu and O orbitals, owing to the directional character of the constituent orbitals. So, finding an appropriate host structure for minimizing hybridization between Cu and O while allowing them to still weakly interact should be a promising route for generating flat bands at EF which can lead to interesting electronic phenomena, regardless of whether LK-99 is a room-temperature superconductor.","lk99_veracity":"neutral","means":-0.6299212598,"iter_variances":0.449943757,"likelihood":0.1586552539,"likelihood_adjusted":0.0807566592},{"paper_title":"Magical or magnetic?

Based on our calculations, we found that without Cu doping, the lead apatite PPOO shows an insulator character with flatbands that straddle the Fermi level. Once we introduce O1 vacancies, the flatbands disappear. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of Cu doping on the crystal structure and the electronic band structure of the material PCPOO4. Our calculations reveal the presence of one-dimensional channels induced by fully occupied O1 atoms that are only 1\/4 occupied in the literature, which may play a crucial role in the realization of room-temperature superconductivity. Based on our findings, we propose a possible solution to improve the quality of superconductivity by annealing the material in an oxygen atmosphere. These results contribute to a better understanding of the unusual properties of Cu-doped lead apatite PCPOO4 and will pave the way for further exploration of its potential as a room-temperature superconductor.","lk99_veracity":"neutral","means":-0.668633235,"iter_variances":0.1966568338,"likelihood":0.0445654628,"likelihood_adjusted":0.0003369293},{"paper_title":"Replication and study of anomalies in LK-99\u2014the alleged ambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductor","doi":"10.1088\/1361-6668\/ad2b78","journal":"Superconductor Science and Technology","journal_if":3.5,"citations":5,"date":1708473600000,"abstract":"We have studied LK-99 [Pb10\u2212xCux(PO4)6O], alleged by Lee et al to exhibit superconductivity\nabove room temperature and at ambient pressure, and have reproduced all anomalies in electric\nand magnetic measurements that they reported as evidence for the claim of LK-99 being an\nambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductor.

In this paper, we present the results of synthesized LK-99 using a systematic approach based on quenching method variations. A slower cooling rate resulted in an increased LK-99 phase and a decreased Cu2S phase, with the slowest cooling method achieving the highest concentration of the LK-99 phase. Magnetic levitation was observed in certain specimens, with one end adhering to the magnet and the other end floating, which was distinguished from the Meissner effect. The majority of samples synthesized under different conditions exhibited no response to the magnet. The slowest cooled sample exhibited mostly insulating behavior. The samples synthesized in the other conditions had metallic behaviors, which contained a significant amount of Cu2S.
